A JavaScript implementation of the JWZ (Jamie Zawinski) email conversation threading algorithm ([http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html](http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html))

This is a more or less direct port of [https://github.com/fdietz/jwz_threading](https://github.com/fdietz/jwz_threading) by Frederik Dietz, which is implemented in Ruby. I needed a JS port so here we are!

See the tests for example usage. To run the tests execute `node jwz_test.js`. No output means everything passed :)
